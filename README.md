# creditriskmodelling
Developed a credit risk model for CredX to minimize credit losses by identifying suitable applicants. Used WOE to clean data, built predictive models on demographic and credit bureau data, and created a scorecard to assess default risk. Evaluated the financial benefits by calculating potential credit loss avoided and auto-approval impact.
